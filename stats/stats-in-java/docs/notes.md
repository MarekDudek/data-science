# Full Bayesian analysis

1. Observe data
2. Form a hypothesis
3. Update beliefs based on the data

# UFO example

1. Data we're observing
  * bright light
  * saucer-shaped object
  
Description based on past experience: **surprising**

_P(bright light, saucer-shaped object) = very low_

_P_ - probability

Read as: 

_probability of observing bright light and saucer-shaped object is very low_

comma-separated events: combined probability of multiple events

probability of _both_ events occurring _together_

estimated probability based on intuition(?)

_P(rain) = likely_

# _Prior beliefs_ and _Conditioning Probabilities_

_P(bright light, saucer-shaped object|experience on Earth) = very low_

_experience on Earth_ - **Prior Beliefs**

_P(comma-separated events|prior beliefs) = conditional probability_

Shorter names:

_D_ = bright light, saucer-shaped object

_P(D)_ - probability of set of **data**

_X_ = **experience** on Earth

_P(D|X)_ - probability of set of data given prior beliefs

_P(bright light, saucer-shaped object|July 4th, experience on Earth) = low_

probability changed from _very low_ to _low_

Given _prior experiences_ we believe that probability of _set of events_ is such and such.

# Forming a hypothesis

We have data, _D_ and prior experience, _E_. **In order to explain what we just saw** we need to form some kind of **hypothesis**.
**Hypotheses** come in many forms.

Examples
1. Given belief that Earth rotates we predict exact times of sunrise and sunset
2. Given belief that our favorite team is the best we predict (with high probability) that they will win more then other teams
3. Given we believe in astrology we believe predict that alignments of stars will describe people and events
4. Given we apply certain treatment a scientist predicts that it will slow progress of disease
5. Given we apply a model analyst predicts behaviour of market

Some way of understanding the world and using that understanding to make predictions about how the world will behave

We are concerned with how well they predict the data we observe.
